## üöÄ Overview

Exif Editor is a professional macOS utility for inspecting, editing, and cleaning EXIF metadata embedded in photos. Modern digital cameras, DSLRs, and smartphones automatically add metadata to every image ‚Äî including camera model, lens, shutter speed, aperture, ISO, geolocation (GPS coordinates), date and time, and much more. While useful, this data can reveal personal information, affect privacy, or simply clutter your image library.  

With Exif Editor you gain complete control: you can view metadata in detail, correct inaccurate information, remove sensitive data like GPS tags, or batch-process multiple files. The app is built with photographers, designers, archivists, and privacy-conscious users in mind. Whether you want to clean images before sharing online, document technical details of your shots, or prepare images for publishing, Exif Editor provides a clean, reliable workflow.  

Unlike basic image viewers, Exif Editor allows advanced modifications such as adjusting time stamps, changing camera/lens tags, or setting custom fields. It supports common formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG) and reads RAW file metadata as well. Its interface is minimal and macOS-native, ensuring fast and efficient edits without steep learning curves.
